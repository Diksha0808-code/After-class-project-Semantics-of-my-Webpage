<h2>What is Technology?</h2>
<p></p>Technology can be knowledge of how to do things. Some machiness have automatic controls. 
This lets others use the machines without knowing how they work. Technological systems use technology 
by taking something, changing it, then producing a result. They are also known as technology systems.</p>

<p></p>The most simple form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. 
The discovery of fire and the Neolithic Revolution made food easier to get. Other inventions,
 such as the wheel and the ship, helped people to transport goods and themselves. Information technology,
  such as the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, has led to globalization.</p>

<p>People have used technology for millions of years. Without food technology, most people would die.There are many different 
types of technology, differing in historical invention and application,as well as by the type of problem they solve. 
Types of technology include mechanical technology, medical technology, communications technology, electronic technology,
 and industrial and manufacturing technologies.Though these different types of technology all serve different purposes, 
 range in design, and are applied in different ways, they all have one thing in common: they all solve a problem.</p>

<h2>The Impact of Technology:-</h2>
<p>Technological change is the largest cause of long-term economic growth.[62][63] Throughout human history, 
energy production was the main constraint on economic development, and new technologies allowed humans to 
significantly increase the amount of available energy. First came fire, which made edible a wider variety of foods, 
and made it less physically demanding to digest them. Fire also enabled smelting, and the use of tin, copper, and 
iron tools, used for hunting or tradesmanship. Then came the agricultural revolution: humans no longer needed to hunt
or gather to survive, and began to settle in towns and cities, forming more complex societies, with militaries and
more organized forms of religion.[64]Technologies have contributed to human welfare through increased prosperity,
improved comfort and quality of life, and medical progress, but they can also disrupt existing social hierarchies, 
cause pollution, and harm individuals or groups. Recent years have brought about a rise in social media's
cultural prominence, with potential repercussions on democracy, and economic and social life. Early on, the 
internet was seen as a "liberation technology" that would democratize knowledge, improve access to education,
and promote democracy. Modern research has turned to investigate the internet's downsides, including 
disinformation, polarization, hate speech, and propaganda.[65] Since the 1970s, technology's impact on
the environment has been criticized, leading to a surge in investment in solar, wind, and other forms of
clean energy.</p>

     <h2>The security of Technology:-</h2>
<p>With the growing reliance of technology, there have been security and privacy concerns along with it.
Billions of people use different online payment methods, such as WeChat Pay, PayPal, Alipay, and much 
more to help transfer money. Although security measures are placed, some criminals are able to bypass 
them.[78] In March 2022, North Korea used Blender.io, a mixer which helped them to hide their cryptocurrency
exchanges, to launder over $20.5 million in cryptocurrency, from Axie Infinity, and steal over $600 million
worth of cryptocurrency from the game's owner. Because of this, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned 
Blender.io, which marked the first time it has taken action against a mixer, to try and crack down on
North Korean hackers.[79][80] The privacy of cryptocurrency has been debated. Although many customers like
the privacy of cryptocurrency, many also argue that it needs more transparency and stability.</p>
